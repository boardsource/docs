# Why Lube Your Switches?

Have you ever wanted your keyboard to sound quieter? Maybe sound deeper and
thock like the other boards? What about feel smoother than ever, even for
tactile switches? Lubing switches is the secret improvement that so many people
seem to miss.

## What lube to use?

There are many options for lube out there for keyboards, but most of the
community seems to agree on a few options that are their favorites. Linear and
tactile switches do, however, change what lube is recommended!

For linear switches, these are generally recommended.

- Krytox 205g0
