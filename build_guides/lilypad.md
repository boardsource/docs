Welcome to the lulu build guide, here you will find a step by step guide on how
to build your lulu as well as a list of items your kit(s) should contain. Please
follow this guide in its entirety, if you have any questions or need more
hands-on help you can [enter the Discord](https://discord.gg/b4R25WSZvH) and ask
under the #build-help channel.

We recommend you do each step on both halves of the keyboard prior to moving on
to the next step, but of course you can also complete a side and then do the
next, the choice is yours.

**IMPORTANT:** When using a split keyboard, it is extremely important that you
plug in the halves and then the board to your computer in the correct order.
This is the correct order to follow:

Plugging In the Board: First connect the halves via TRRS, then plug the board
into your computer via USB.

Unplugging The Board: Disconnect the board from your computer, then unplug the
halves TRRS connection.

**DO NOT PLUG/UNPLUG THE TRRS CABLE WHEN THE BOARD IS PLUGGED IN TO YOUR
COMPUTER**

## Install OLED Cover and Plug Into Aluminum Top Case

![oled
plug](https://boardsource.imgix.net/d61c0a30-704c-11ec-8d83-278e60308b52.gif)

**Required Parts In This Section:**
* 2x aluminum top case
* 2x OLED cover (frosted or clear)
* 2x OLED plug
* 4x m2x6mm flat head bolt

From the backside of the top case (front laying down on a surface) insert the
OLED Cover into the OLED window. Line up the cutouts on the OLED cover with the
posts on the aluminum. You can apply a bit of force in order to fully seat it.
When you think the cover is fully seated, inspect the cover from the front, the
cover should be close to flush with the aluminum. If it seems to be inset too
much, you likely installed the cover upside down.

Again from the back of the top case, inset the OLED Retention Plug into the
case. There is only one correct orientation for this piece, simply align the
cutouts on the piece with the posts on the aluminum and insert. Fasten the OLED
retention plug to the top case with the conical flush head phillips screws in
the Case Kit Box. Tighten the retention plug until it is flush with the
aluminum. Do not over tighten the OLED Retention Plug or cracking may occur.

With the OLED Retention Plug properly installed and fastened, you can make small
final adjustments by hand to the OLED Cover to ensure the final fit is flush
with the aluminum on the top side. Slight movements will not cause any cracking
and the cover should stay in place.

PRO TIP: Prior to moving on, clean the OLED Cover to remove any smudges or marks
you made during installation. The clear OLED Cover is easily scratched, we
recommended using a glasses cleaning cloth/microfiber cloth, do not apply too
much pressure when cleaning. The underside will be hard to get to later, so it’s
best to clean it now.
 
## Install Encoder Plug

![encoder
plug](https://boardsource.imgix.net/29caec00-704d-11ec-8546-2f1606942334.gif)

**NOTE:** This section is only applicable if you purchased a Rotary Encoder Kit,
if you did not then simply move on to the next step.

**Required Parts In This Section:**
* 2x Aluminum Top Case
* 2x Encoder Plug

Now we are going to insert the Encoder Plugs into the Aluminum Top Case. It is
important to differentiate the left plug from the right plug, as they are not
the same. Forcing the incorrect plug into the wrong side may cause damage to the
plug.

If you inspect the Encoder Plugs closely, you will notice each plug has 3
corners that are 90° corners, and one is a bit weird with an angle. That angle
is meant to match the ‘pointy bit’ of aluminum that sits above the thumb key on
each half of the lulu. Additionally, if you inspect the sidewalls of the Encoder
Plug you will notice one has a small cutout towards the bottom. This cutout
helps with removal of this plug in the future. On each half, that cutout is
supposed to face towards the keys. In other words, the left plug’s cutout faces
left, and the right plug’s cutout faces right when installed properly.

Let’s check which plug is which by confirming where the ‘weird angled corner’
lines up when you orient the cutout correct. When oriented properly, the left
half’s Encoder Plug will have its weird corner in the bottom left, and when the
cutout on the right Encoder Plug is oriented correct it will have its weird
corner in the bottom right.

When in doubt, sit back, take a deep breath, and imagine how this piece would
look if you inserted it into the key switch location. The weird corner’s angle
should CONTINUE the angle of the pointy aluminum, not interfere or intersect
with it. I am sorry this is semi difficult to explain, we will add some pictures
in the future.

Now that you’re (hopefully) sure which half the Encoder Plug belongs to figured
out, we can start inserting them into the key switch location. Make sure the key
switch location is clear of any debris prior to installation or it will cause
the plug to sit proud of the aluminum.

Place the Encoder Plug into the key switch location and let it rest. Check to
make sure it’s aligned properly by looking straight down on it, and try to
ensure the top of the plug is laying flat, not at an angle. With even force
apply downward pressure onto the plug, it should click into place. If you aren’t
able to seat the plug, one of two things are happening, either you aren’t
applying enough force, or you’re using the wrong side’s plug. Before attempting
installation again, double check the orientation of the plug, realign it, and
apply even downward pressure again. This takes a bit of force, but gets easier
after use if you remove/re-insert it over time.

When installed properly the Encoder Plug should sit flush with the aluminum. If
it does not sit flush, you can try applying a bit more force. If issues persist,
remove the encoder plug and inspect the plug and surrounding areas for any
debris.

## Solder Encoder to PCB

![encoder](https://boardsource.imgix.net/322faa20-704d-11ec-8546-2f1606942334.gif)

**NOTE:** This section is only applicable if you purchased a Rotary Encoder Kit,
if you did not then simply move on to the next step.

**Required Parts In This Section:**
* 2x Rotary Encoders
* 1x lulu PCB or Lily58 PCB with rotary encoder support
* Soldering Iron
* Solder

Prior to installing the Rotary Encoder onto the PCB, check to make sure each of
the connection legs on the encoder are straight. They are fairly easy to bend
and this causes issues during installation. Simply straighten each leg out to
help with easy installation.

The rotary encoder can only be placed onto the PCB in one orientation, make sure
to match up the number of legs with the number of holes on the PCB. The 3 pins
should point down towards the thumb clusters. Insert the rotary encoder into the
PCB and make sure that it is fully seated and resting on the PCB flat.
Improper/uneven installation will cause fitment issues elsewhere.

With the rotary encoder properly installed on the PCB, flip the PCB over and
solder the 5 connection leads, and then solder the 2 retention legs. It is smart
to periodically flip the PCB over to confirm the encoder is fully seated onto
the PCB and resting on it and did not raise or move at all. Be careful not to
heat the pads near the hot swap socket too much, and you do not need to apply an
abundance of solder. Nothing bad will happen if you burn the hot swap socket,
but it may cause a bit of an ugly mark. It is very possible to solder all leads
without disturbing the hot swap socket.

## Install OLED-S

**Note:** This section is only applicable if you purchased OLED-S with your
lulu, if not move on to the next step.

Unpackage the OLED-S from the anti-static bag it comes in. Install OLED-S into
the 4 header pin sockets (in one strip) on the front of the PCB below the
microcontroller. Simply align the posts on the OLED-S with the header piin
sockets, and apply downward pressure. When fully inserted into the sockets, you
can bend the pins slightly if you need to make it more level.

## Insert Alignment Switches Into Plate

![switches](https://boardsource.imgix.net/4e39db50-704d-11ec-88ec-df9325c6e667.gif)

**Required Parts In This Section:**
* 2x Aluminum Top Case
* ~8x Switches of Your Choice

To help connect the PCB to the plate/switches, it helps to put a few switches
through the plate first. This allows you to have a few switches per half help
hold up the PCB. Simply insert 4-6 switches per half, trying to get them in all
four corners and not all in the same spot. If you’re looking at the top case
with the number row facing up, the switch legs too should face ‘up.’ Take a look
at the PCB, imagine how the switches go into the hot swap sockets in the next
step, and confirm you’re orienting the switches into the plate properly.

## Connect PCB to Switches and Plate

![pcb](https://boardsource.imgix.net/66be4120-704d-11ec-8546-2f1606942334.gif)

**Required Parts In This Section:**
* 2x Aluminum Top Case
* 2x PCB Halves
* Plate Foam (Optional)

If you have not snapped away the permitter pieces on your PCBs yet, do so at
this time. You can simply use your hands and snap them off, pliers can help a
bit if small remnants are left behind. The PCBs must be totally separated from
one another for this to work.

Lay your top case (with alignment switches installed) face down onto the table.
You should not see the colored switch stem, that’s against the table. You should
see the legs of the switches from this view.

NOTE: If you’re using plate foam, you’re going to need to install that now. When
the top case upside down, insert it into the top case in the proper orientation.
You should see it align perfectly with the curves of the case and the switch
holes.

Now you may place the PCB for that half on top of the alignment switches, doing
your best to align the hot swap sockets with the switch legs. You can sometimes
feel it ‘drop’ a TINY bit into place, this means you aligned it well and the
switch legs are ready to be inserted into the hot swap sockets. Press down on
each hot swap socket that has an alignment switch inserted. You should be able
to feel the PCB push down and see the ends of the switch legs through the hot
swap socket. Do this for each alignment switch.

When each alignment switch is properly inserted into the top case, and each hot
swap socket is properly seated, you should be able to pick up the assembly and
it won’t drop or fall. The PCB, switches, plate, and top case are now all
connected via these alignment switches. You can press them all together once
more to ensure proper installation. If one does not seat properly or something
isn’t looking quite right, make sure the switch is oriented properly, there are
four possible directions a switch can be inserted, and only one is correct to
line up with the holes in the hot swap socket. Even if inserted properly, it is
also possible the switch legs are bent, this will also cause the switch to not
seat properly. Do not use too much pressure or force anything when performing
this step. A reasonable amount of force can be used to seat the switches into
the hot swap socket, but if you’re forcing anything or pressing too hard it
means something is wrong, and you run the risk of popping a hot swap socket off
the PCB.

## Install Knob Onto Rotary Encoder

**NOTE:** This section is only applicable if you purchased a Rotary Encoder Kit,
if you did not then simply move on to the next step.

![knob](https://boardsource.imgix.net/5d243750-704d-11ec-a2da-010e6cffaa5a.gif)

**Required Parts In This Section:**
* 2x Encoder Knob

With the PCB attached to the top case assembly via switches, if you have a
rotary encoder installed on your PCB you should now see the stem from the top
side through the Encoder Plug. If this doesn’t seem to fit, ensure your rotary
encoder is properly seated against the PCB and is completely flat.

Simply insert the Rotary Encoder Knob onto the Rotary Encoder Stem. The Knob can
only be placed onto the stem in a single direction, check to ensure proper
alignment prior to applying pressure. The steam has a single flat side, and the
interior of the knob has a single flat side. Line them up and then apply
downward force. This takes some pressure and is a friction fit, support the PCB
from the back when installing the Knob to make sure you don’t push the PCB away
from the switches and cause them to disconnect.

You will likely hear a click, that is okay it is the ‘press down’ function of
the rotary encoder and makes a clicking noise, nothing broke. Use a bit of
pressure even past that click and fully seat the knob onto the stem. You should
not have to use an extreme amount of pressure or force the knob onto the stem.
If you feel like it isn’t going onto the stem, pleasure confirm the proper
orientation of the knob by aligned the flat surfaces. Forcing the knob onto the
stem in the wrong orientation can crack the knob.

## Insert Remainder of Switches

![rest of
switches](https://boardsource.imgix.net/773d9500-704d-11ec-88ec-df9325c6e667.gif)

Now, you can go through the remainder of the of the switches and insert them
into the assembly from the front. Remember, there is only one way a switch can
be inserted properly, so double check the orientation prior to installation and
also confirm the switch legs are straight. SUPPORT EACH HOT SWAP SOCKET FROM THE
BACK WHEN INSERTING SWITCHES. I use my fingers to support the hot swap from the
back while I press the switch in from the front and go one by one. If you do not
support hot swap sockets from the back during switch installation, it is
possible they will pop off the PCB causing permanent damage. Ensure each switch
is fully seated into the plate and hotswap socket.

## Install Tenting Legs

**NOTE:** This section is only applicable if you purchased a Tenting Kit, if you
did not then simply move on to the next step.

![tenting](https://boardsource.imgix.net/83bb0fb0-704d-11ec-8d83-278e60308b52.gif)

**Required Parts In This Section:**
* 2x PC Lower Pieces
* 2x Tenting Legs in the angle of your choice
*  4x M2 x 4mm Conical Flush Head Phillips Screw

Take a single screw and place it into the appropriate hole on the interior of
the lower piece. Using three hands, hold that screw in place with your
screwdriver while you properly align the tenting leg with the screw from the
other side. Tighten the screw to fasten the tenting leg to the lower piece.
Insert the other screw and attach the other side of the tenting leg to the lower
bottom piece.

Do not over tighten screws, if you try to lock these down with an immense amount
of force, it is possible to unset the threaded insert in the tenting leg.
However, it is totally fine to tighten them enough where you ensure there is
zero movement or wobble in the tenting leg. When properly tightened the tenting
leg should not move at all.
## Finale Keyboard Assembly 

![final](https://boardsource.imgix.net/8c586a00-704d-11ec-8d83-278e60308b52.gif)

**Required Parts In This Section:**
* 2x PC Bottom Pieces with Tenting Legs Installed (If Applicable)
* 2x Aluminum Top Case with PCB, Switches, OLED, OLED Covers, and OLED Plugs
  Installed
* 8x M2x6mm Cap Head Bolt
* 1.5mm Allen (Hex) Key

Lay the Aluminum Top Case upside down on a surface (resting on the switches)
then align the polycarbonate lower piece on top of it. The pieces should align
themselves and you will see the threaded posts through the holes on the lower
piece. Connect the pieces together using the Hex Cap Head Bolts, 4 per half. Do
not over tighten these bolts, as too much pressure may cause gaps. Just snug
them up and everything should be secure and aligned properly.
