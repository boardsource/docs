**A Note for Lily Pad Builders:**

Welcome to the Lily Pad build guide! The Lily Pad case design is heavily inspired by the Unicorne, meaning the assembly process is virtually identical.

- **About the Images:** You'll notice that many images in this guide show the Unicorne keyboard. Don't worry! The assembly steps are the same for your Lily Pad. Please follow the visual instructions as they apply directly to your build.
- **PCB Choices:** The Lily Pad case is designed primarily for use with the LULU PCB. However, it's also compatible with standard Lily58 PCBs that utilize a Pro Micro (or a compatible microcontroller). While this guide focuses on assembly with the LULU PCB, the general steps for case assembly will be relevant for both PCB types.

# Step 1 The Break!

If you are using a LULU PCB, it has rails from assembly that need to be broken off and discarded. If you are using a different PCB like a Lily58 with a Pro Micro, this step may not be necessary.

# Step 2 Line it up.

Aligning the plate, plate foam, and PCB is a straightforward process, as they
are designed to fit together in only one specific orientation. Ensuring proper
alignment is crucial for optimal performance and stability. Just take your time
to make sure the switch holes line up between the plate->foam->pcb.

You should be left with a stack that sits:

- **FR4 Plate**
- **Foam**
- **PCB**

**Note on Choc Builds:** Due to the shorter height there is not enough space
between the plate and the PCB for foam so no foam is required(or included).

# Step 3 Put the Switches in!

Now that all the holes line up you can insert your switches. Make sure that you
line up the metal pins on the switch with the hotswap on the PCB each switch can
only go in one way to work. When inserting your switch support the back of the
hotswap to insure you dont break the PCB while installing switches (which can
happen if the switch is miss aligned.)

Now you can test your PCB to make sure every switch works if not pop out the
switch that does not work and check for bent pins.

# Step 4 Installing OLED Covers.

Start by installing the 10mm post on the PCB through the plate, this is the mounting point for the
OLED Cover.

Next you can install the acrylic covers onto the post.

**NOTE:** When installing joysticks you can't have the acrylic cover on the
joystick.

# Step 5 Getting so Close.

Drop your PCB / Plate / Switch assembly into the case.
Screw it in using the screws included with your case.

# Step 6 Keycaps.

Throw your favorite keycap set on and enjoy your new keyboard.
The thumb keys are 1.5u keycaps.

# Step 7 Tenting.

If you Got tenting legs they are very easy to install and you simply screw them onto the bottom of the case.
feet on the bottom of the case make sure you dont scratch your case.
The tenting legs have been designed to be quick to install and remove for travel
